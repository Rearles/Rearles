- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rearles
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about coding languages (C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc.) as well as other frameworks (Microsoft .NET).
- 🌱 I've been in training for the last couple of months with Revature to become a .NET Full Stack Developer. The repos for the projects from training are on my Github. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun projects and interesting concepts. Feel free to reach out if you have something cool you are working on.
- 📫 How to reach me email me at ryanjayearles@gmail.com
